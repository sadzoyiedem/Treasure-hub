        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>
            To upload an item you'll need to have an account. This helps us to link you up with the owner and also pay you seamlessly.
            However, claiming items does not necesserily require you to have an account. But in the case we have to link you up with the finder you'll have to give us the need/required details so we can make that happen. If the finder demands some amount, you can always pay without an account. <br>
